\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I first of all want to thank my advisor Prof Vincenzo Chiochia, for his trust in my abilities and his mentoring, which is of prime importance in such a large collaboration.

I owe special gratitude towards to Dr. Evan Friis, who sharpened my programming skills as well as my physics ones, and was a real pleasure to work in close contact with him, and to Dr. Hella Snoek for her support and for her wake-up call, leading me to understand that I was able to take matters in my own hands.

I want to thank Prof. Sridhara Dasu for his guidance in the Higgs to tau group, especially in the hard periods before the final approval of the analysis and the Tau Physics Object Group, and in particular its two conveners Dr. Monica Acosta and Dr. Christian Veelken, which acted like a second institution for me and helped me throughout my studies.

A special thank also to my fiancee Jessica and my parents for their help and support in these four years, which included some difficult periods, like every doctoral study, that would have been much harder without the presence of a caring companion and supportive relatives.

I finally want to thank the University Zurich group: Silvia, Carlotta, Barbara, William and Mirena for sharing with me this journey, our secretaries Carmelina, Ruth and Monica because I'm really unable to process bureaucracy, and in general all the friends that I've made during these four years, who helped making my working and private life better.
